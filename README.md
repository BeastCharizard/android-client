Client for android for pokemon online

Needs the [ViewPagerIndicator][1] library. If git submodule worked properly, you just have to import viewpagerindicator/library in eclipse as Android code. Otherwise, download first the zip for the viewpagerindicator source and extract it in a viewpagerindicator subfolder.
